Threads folder contains an example of threading: 
    There are three scripts. 
    even_number_generator.py will generate an even number every 3 seconds 
    odd_number_generator.py will generate an odd number every 5 seconds
    thread_script.py will create two threads for the two scripts and execute both. 
    To see the example simply run the following code via shell.
        python thread_script.py
